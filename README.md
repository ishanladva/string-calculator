# String Calculator Kata

This is a simple implementation of the **String Calculator Kata** using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and following the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. The goal of this Kata is to develop a string calculator that can handle various arithmetic operations from a string input.

## Features

- The calculator can handle an empty string input (returns `0`).
- The calculator can handle simple string inputs containing numbers separated by commas (e.g., `"1,2,3"`).
- The calculator will add the numbers together and return the sum.
- The project is developed using **TypeScript** and tested with **Mocha** and **Chai** for unit testing.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** version 14 or higher
- **TypeScript** version 4.x or higher
- **Mocha** (for testing)
- **Chai** (for assertions)
- **ts-node** (for running TypeScript files directly)
